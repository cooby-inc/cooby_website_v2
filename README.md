### Install 
```
git clone [the-repo-url] // clone this repo 
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install // install to get node packages 
```

### Development 

First, sync remote update and open your new branch 

```
git checkout master // go to master branch 
git pull origin master  
git checkout -b your-new-branch // create a branch 
```
Then, use Gulp to run locally 

```
gulp
```


### Ship 

Commit and push your change 

```
git add . 
git commit -m "your-message"
git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name // or just git push if you have done this step 
```

*Open a Pull Request on GitHub*.  _Once PR's opened, Netlify will get you a Netlify preview link, so you can test it before merge to the master branch_

After the preview is verified, merge to PR to `master` branch. Netlify will deploy the site.
