              We know the Extension touches the most personal part of our lives - our messaging inbox, so we design and build it with privacy at heart.
              We don't like hard-to-read 10,000-word privacy notices either. So, we write what we do with your data and how we protect your privacy ourselves. We make our best effort to disclose everything about data and privacy for the Extension.
              We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important!<br><br>
              This privacy notice applies to only the information collected through our Extension.<br><br>

            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              We do not collect your WhatsApp chat data including any messages and contacts. None of your chat data leaves your computer. Technically speaking, in fact, currently the Extension does not even connect to a Cooby server. It's 100% client-side.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-800">
              We use product analytics software such as Amplitude to track your user activities on Extension-related UI elements, i.e. the header. That includes all operations on tabs such as clicks or re-ordering. The software also tracks browser and request metadata such as countries, states, and device info (Yes, we know if it's a Windows or Mac). However, we anonymize user-generated content when sending data back to product analytics software.<br><br>
              We do not track your activities on native WhatsApp Web elements, e.g. clicks on a chat or typing out messages.<br><br>
              When we send data back to product analytics software, we create a hash string that represents you as a user uniquely. There is no way to derive any personal identifiable information, such as your WhatsApp ID or number, from the hash. It's fully anonymized.

              We run anonymous surveys to understand how you like our service and how we can improve it. These surveys aren't associated with your personal information, unless we explicitly ask you to fill in contact info such as emails or phone numbers, so we can follow up with your feedback, given your consent.<br><br>
              Your tab settings are currently stored in your Chrome profile storage, associated with the Google account logged in the browser. It does not reside in our servers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              We use the anonymized user activity data collected via product analytics software as well as survey responses to understand how you use our Extension and improve our service.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              NO. We will never share or sell your data in any shape or form. Period. It's only used to improve the product internally.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              As mentioned above, we use product analytics software that only tracks your usage of *our features* i.e. the tabs plus the Cooby logo menu. The tracking is anonymized, meaning that we cannot trace collected activities back to a real human.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              5. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              Likely yes. While we currently do not host our own servers to store any of your data for the Extension, the product analytics software we use have servers around the world. Therefore, the anonymized user activities are likely transferred internationally.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
              We plan to keep the anonymized user activities as long as needed in order to continue improving our service.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3">
              7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-800">
